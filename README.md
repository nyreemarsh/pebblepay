# PibblePay  
*A playful smart-contract playground powered by SpoonOS + Neo.*

PibblePay is a SpoonOS-powered smart contract playground that turns complex blockchain interactions into simple, stackable 'pebbles' that anyone can build with.

A whimsical, approachable way to create, customise, and execute smart contracts. Powered by SpoonOS. Built for play, safety, and simplicity.

PibblePay is an experimental **visual and natural-language smart contract builder** designed for beginners, creators, freelancers, and small businesses who want to use Web3 without touching complex code.  
Users describe what they want in **plain English**, and PibblePay converts it into:

- a **structured smart-contract visualisation**,  
- clean **smart-contract logic**, and  
- optional **on-chain deployment** to the Neo testnet.

PibblePay aims to make Web3 feel like a **creative playground**, not a command line.
